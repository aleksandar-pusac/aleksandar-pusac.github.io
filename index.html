                    <p>As the industry grows and expands in terms of technologies that are available I am constantly trying to improve myself and extend my skill set in order to maintain providing the best user experience to my clients and the end users. Most of the time I am working as a full-stack Wordpress developer. Wordpress is my fields of interest since it's initial release as well as Bootstrap. Being a part of the Trilby Media team I got acquainted with Tailwind UI and instantly fell in love with it since it provides me the flexibility that I miss with other libraries. I find it as a big break through in this field and I absolutely love using it. It totally changed my POV to how CSS actually should and could be used. The chance to be a part of the team behind it thrills me in the ways I can't even describe.
                        With my dedication and professionalism I find myself a great fit for this role and I hope you will see the same.

                    <p class="mb-0">Besides that my main interest is developing myself in both professional and personal way by constantly seeking ways to improve myself as a developer and as a father/husband. I enjoy hiking and since all of my life I was into sports I still play basketball on a weekly basis.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">People find me a a focused and determined to achieve any goal I set my mind to and this is a quality I will bring to any team I will be a part off.</p>

I can let his creative mind go to work knowing he has great understanding of building websites. Easy to work with and communicates well. I will use him again for website updates and recommend him to my friends.
                            Thank you."</p>
                            <p>"Amazing work by Aleksandar on time and excellent communication. He is great with front-end development"</p>
                            <p>"Aleksandar is a great front end developer. He is punctual and always ready to jump on a project. We will be in touch again."</p>
                            <p>"He's a very good professional, does a super job! Will hire him again if I need his skills"</p>
                            <p>"Great guy to work with. Communication is Excellent"</p>
                            <p>“I contracted Aleksandar Pusac as a UI/UX developer to our project more than a year ago. He has been part of designing and building a process support tool within recruitment and outplacement. The work has been clearly divided into independent competence areas with a high degree of creative freedom but with common team goals.
                                Aleksandar has proven himself as a very competent UI/UX developer with the ability to visualize his ideas and convictions about intuitive and user friendly interface design. He has a very good esthetic perception and his designs are very appropriately balanced. He has a clear understanding of how to make the user interaction easy and intuitive.
                                In our team Aleksandar has worked independently and responsibly, showing a good sense of balance and realism in work estimation, time planning and execution. He has been very reliable and flexible in adapting to the team deadlines and deliverables. It is with great confidence that I recommend him for basically any assignment where his skills and talents in user interface design can come to use. Kristian Veem”</p>
